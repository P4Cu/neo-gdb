Neovim + gdb

## Synopsis

This [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) plugin provides a clean user interface for debugging with GDB.

## Motivation

This plugin has been written after seeing that there's no good and **easy** gdb frontend for neovim. There's no support for vim and there won't be as this plugin uses neovim specific API.

## Installation
